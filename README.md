In my code I implemented most of the features of the application in the backend, but was not able to get them to work in the UI in time for submission. I was able to get foods added to the available foods list, and they would display in the list of available foods when beginning to make a plate, but I encountered an error with my factory method of creating plates which I could not resolve in time. My UI for my app is mostly fleshed out, but still needs to be fully connected to the engine I made for this.
